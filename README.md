# Bootcamper Social.

This is the Front End of our Mid-way project for School of Code, we were presented with the task of creating an app that would help a bootcamper through this experience. After some discussion we decided to create an APP centered around meeting other bootcampers outside of Bootcamp Hours.

App is deployed [here](https://front-end-bootcamper-social.netlify.app/)
